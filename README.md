## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To design and build a worm-like robot capable of autonomous straight-line movement.  
- **Technologies Used**: Arduino Nano, servo motors, 3D printing, CAD design.  
- **Features**:  
  - Mimics the movement of a worm using a series of linked segments.  
  - Autonomous straight-line movement controlled by an Arduino Nano.  
  - Lightweight and compact design for efficient locomotion.

## How It Works
1. The robot’s movement is achieved by sequentially actuating its servo motors to create a wave-like motion.  
2. The Arduino Nano controls the timing and sequence of servo movements to ensure smooth locomotion.  
3. The 3D-printed links are designed to be lightweight and durable, allowing for efficient movement.  

## Results
- Successfully demonstrated autonomous straight-line movement.  
- Achieved **4th place** in a university robotics competition.  
- Received positive feedback for the robot’s innovative design and functionality.  

## Future Improvements
- Integration of sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.  
- Optimization of the locomotion algorithm for faster and more efficient movement.  
- Exploration of alternative materials for improved durability and performance.
